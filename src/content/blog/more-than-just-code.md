Hello, world! Welcome to Codebravo.

For years, I lived on the other side of the code. My path into the software industry wasn't a straight line from a computer science class to a code editor. I started in infrastructure sales, then cloud support, and eventually found myself working as a Product Owner and QA.

I was the person who talked to customers and stakeholders, helping them understand their problems. I wrote the user stories, defined the requirements, and tested the final product. I loved crafting the "what" and the "why," but I always felt limited because I couldn't build the "how." The curiosity to get my hands dirty and truly build the solutions I was defining became a feeling I couldn't ignore.

### The Disconnect I Couldn't Ignore

As a QA, I started seeing a recurring pattern. Feature after feature, I'd find issues that weren't just simple bugs. The most common error I saw was a fundamental misunderstanding of the customer's needs. The code was often clever and technically sound, but it solved the wrong problem.

The disconnect wasn't in the syntax; it was in the context.

That’s when I knew I had to cross the bridge. I started learning to code during my nights and weekends, driven by the desire to not just identify problems, but to craft the solutions myself.

### Seeing Code as a Tool, Not a Trophy

This journey has fundamentally shaped my view of software development. To me, code is the ultimate tool for problem-solving, but it's still a tool.

The biggest blind spot I see in our industry is the tendency to fall in love with the tool itself, forgetting the purpose it serves. We chase the fancy new framework, the perfectly clean architecture, or the most elegant algorithm, and we forget that we build software for a reason, to generate revenue, to make someone's job easier, to bring an idea to life.

My time as a PO taught me to obsess over the customer's problem. My time as a QA taught me to demand excellence in the user experience. Now, as a developer, I bring those lessons into every line of code I write.

### What to Expect Here at Codebravo

This blog is my commitment to bridging the gap between code and context. We'll go deep on technical topics, but always with an eye on the bigger picture. You can expect:

* **Problem-First Technical Guides:** We won’t just explore new tech; we’ll always start with the real-world problem it solves for a user or a business.
* **Decoding the Developer's Blind Spot:** We'll talk about the things they don't teach in bootcamps, understanding business goals, sales and marketing strategies for software, and how to truly understand your users.
* **Learning Out Loud:** I don't have all the answers. I'm still diving deeper into UX/UI design, system design, and more. I'll share my learning process with you, the mistakes, the questions, and the breakthroughs as honestly as I can.

Whether you're a developer who wants to better understand the "why" behind your work, or you're just curious about the craft of building software, I'm glad you're here. Let's build something great together.

Thanks for stopping by,

*Carlos*

Through my career I have been in multiple types of roles, started my journey working in sales and customer support and I have been in the Software Development industry for the past 3 years, first in a Product position, now as a Software Developer.

I have always loved to learn and explore different things, I will share what I know with you and you will also learn about the different ventures I embark in my journey.

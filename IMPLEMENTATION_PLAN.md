# Codebravo Blog Implementation Plan

This comprehensive implementation plan will get your blog "Codebravo" launched today with the tagline "From code to craft. Mastering modern development."

## Phase 1: Local Configuration & Personalization

### 1.1 Primary Configuration File
The main configuration file is located at `src/config/config.json`. This file contains all the site settings including title, description, and author information.

**Required modifications to `src/config/config.json`:**

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "Codebravo",
    "base_url": "https://codebravo.dev",
    "base_path": "/",
    "trailing_slash": false,

### 1.3 Logo and Favicon Images
Replace the following image files in the `/public/images/` directory with your own branded versions:

- `/public/images/favicon.png` - Site favicon (typically 32x32 or 16x16 pixels)
- `/public/images/logo.png` - Main logo for light theme
- `/public/images/logo-darkmode.png` - Logo variant for dark theme
- `/public/images/avatar.png` - Author avatar image
- `/public/images/og-image.png` - Open Graph image for social sharing

### 1.4 Author Configuration
Create a new author file at `src/content/authors/carlosnbr.md`:

```markdown
---

Passionate software developer with expertise in modern web technologies, cloud architecture, and developer tooling. I love sharing knowledge and helping other developers grow in their craft.
```

### 1.5 About Page Update
Update `src/content/about/-index.md` with your information:

```markdown
---
title: "Hey, I am Carlos Bravo!"
meta_title: "About"
description: "Learn more about Carlos Bravo and the Codebravo blog"

Hi! I'm Carlos Bravo, a passionate software developer who believes that great code is both functional and beautiful. Through Codebravo, I share insights about modern development practices, emerging technologies, and lessons learned from real-world projects.

From code to craft - that's my philosophy. I believe that writing software is as much an art as it is a science, and I'm excited to share this journey with you.
```

## Phase 2: Content Preparation

### 2.1 Remove Demo Content
Navigate to the blog directory and remove all existing demo posts:

```bash
cd src/content/blog/
rm post-1.md post-2.md post-3.md post-4.md
```

### 2.2 Create Your First Blog Post
Create a new file `src/content/blog/why-i-started-this-blog.md` with the following content:

```markdown
---
title: "Why I Started This Blog"
meta_title: ""
description: "Sharing my journey from code to craft and why I'm passionate about modern development"
date: 2025-09-28T10:00:00Z
image: "/images/banner.png"
categories: ["Personal", "Development"]
author: "carlosnbr"
tags: ["blogging", "development", "career"]
draft: false

Hello, world! Welcome to Codebravo - my corner of the internet where I share insights about modern software development, lessons learned from real projects, and thoughts on the craft of coding.

## Why Codebravo?

The name "Codebravo" comes from my belief that great software development is both technical skill and creative expression. "Code" represents the technical foundation - the syntax, algorithms, and systems we build. "Bravo" acknowledges the artistry - the elegant solutions, user experience, and pride we take in our work.

## What to Expect

Here you'll find:
- **Technical deep-dives** into modern frameworks, tools, and practices
- **Career insights** from my journey as a developer
- **Project case studies** sharing real-world lessons
- **Community spotlights** on tools and people making a difference

## My Mission

I'm here to bridge the gap between "just make it work" and "make it beautiful." I believe that understanding the fundamentals while embracing modern practices leads to better software and happier developers.

Whether you're just starting your coding journey or you're a seasoned developer looking to level up, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

Thanks for stopping by!

*Carlos Bravo*

## Phase 3: Git & Vercel Deployment

### 3.1 Initialize Git Repository
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /Users/carlosbravo/Documents/Projects/astroplate

# Initialize new git repository (this removes existing git history)
rm -rf .git
git init

# Add all project files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up Codebravo blog with personalized content"
```

### 3.2 Connect to GitHub Repository
```bash
# Connect to your new GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/carlosnbr/codebravo-blog.git

# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3.3 Deploy to Vercel
Follow these steps to deploy your blog to Vercel:

1. **Sign in to Vercel**: Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with your GitHub account
2. **Import Project**: Click "Import Project" and select your `codebravo-blog` repository from GitHub
3. **Configure Project**:
   - **Project Name**: `codebravo-blog` (or your preferred name)
   - **Framework Preset**: Astro (should be auto-detected)
   - **Root Directory**: `./` (leave as default)
   - **Build Command**: `yarn build` (or `npm run build`)
   - **Output Directory**: `dist` (leave as default)
   - **Install Command**: `yarn install` (or `npm install`)
4. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy" - Vercel will automatically build and deploy your site
5. **Wait for Deployment**: The deployment process typically takes 2-3 minutes
6. **Access Your Site**: Once complete, Vercel will provide you with a deployment URL (e.g., `https://codebravo-blog.vercel.app`)

**Note**: Default Vercel settings work perfectly for Astro projects, so no additional configuration is needed.

## Phase 4: Connecting the codebravo.dev Domain

### 4.1 Add Custom Domain in Vercel
1. **Open Vercel Dashboard**: Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. **Select Your Project**: Click on your `codebravo-blog` project
3. **Go to Settings**: Click on the "Settings" tab
4. **Navigate to Domains**: Click on "Domains" in the left sidebar
5. **Add Domain**: Click "Add Domain" and enter `codebravo.dev`
6. **Configure Domain**: Select "Add" to proceed with domain configuration

### 4.2 Get DNS Records from Vercel
After adding the domain in Vercel:

1. **Wait for Configuration**: Vercel will check your domain configuration
2. **View DNS Records**: Vercel will display the required DNS records (either A records or CNAME record)
3. **Copy Records**: Note down the exact DNS records provided by Vercel

### 4.3 Configure DNS in Cloudflare
1. **Access Cloudflare Dashboard**: Go to [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and log in
2. **Select Your Domain**: Choose `codebravo.dev` from your domain list
3. **Go to DNS Settings**: Click on "DNS" in the top navigation
4. **Add DNS Records**: For each record provided by Vercel:
   - **Type**: A (for IP addresses) or CNAME (for domain alias)
   - **Name**: Copy exactly as shown in Vercel (usually `@` for root domain)
   - **Value**: Copy the IP address or target domain from Vercel
   - **TTL**: Auto (or 300 seconds)
   - **Proxy Status**: DNS only (uncheck the orange cloud proxy)

### 4.4 Verify and Go Live
1. **Wait for Propagation**: DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate globally
2. **Verify in Vercel**: Return to your Vercel project dashboard and check domain status
3. **SSL Certificate**: Vercel will automatically provision an SSL certificate
4. **Site Goes Live**: Once DNS propagates and SSL is ready, your site will be accessible at `https://codebravo.dev`

**Note**: The DNS configuration process typically takes 5-30 minutes to start working, but can take up to 24 hours for full global propagation.
